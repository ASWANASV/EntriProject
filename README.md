# EntriProject
This project is to evaluate the bike sales data to understand different factors that are considered by the customers before making a purchase decision.
For implemending this, I created pivot tables in excel to understand how different factors such as income,gender,education,marital status,regions,etc. corresponds to each other.
Data srtructure:- 
 The dataset originally has 13 columns and 1001 row fields.the columnns include, ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute 
 Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike.
Methodology:-
 I copied the raw dataset into another sheet so that i can go back to my original dataset in case of errors.I converted it into a table.I performed some data cleanup and 
 processing to make it more understandable.
Data cleaning process include, Removing duplicates.
Data transformation process include, Transforming the currency.
I sorted the dataset by custom sorting on ID,Age and Region.
Created pivot tables on 
   1.Gender based purchase analysis
   2.Distance commute and purchase trend
   3.Purchase analysis based on customers occupation
   4.Income per gender purchase
   5.Purchase by marital status 
   6.Average income per marital status
   7.Region based purchase
   8.purchase by children count
   9.Age based purchase analysis
Dashboard is also created by including pivot charts that helps customers to understand the sales data before making a purchase decision.
Recommentation:- Tailoring marketing efforts to higher income customers would really help a lot.Concentrate on urban areas with shorter comutes.Diversify productes for higher marketing and longer partnership with local bussinesses.Create campaigns amoung adulds and youths focusing on practical benefits and environmental consciousness.Collabrate with employers and events to promote bike commuting.Gather feedbacks.
In conclusion,to capitalise on the corresponding insights stratagic marketing efforts should target higher income individuals,emphasize advantages of biking amoung short commutes,tailor messages amoung specific age groups.Diversification of products can hype the marketing and adderss varinging commuting needs.
The analysis can provide stratagies to refine marketing, optimize product offerings,and foster growth in bike sales market.
